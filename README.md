# Map Data Across the Globe
A D3.js (**Version 3**) visualization app that demonstrates large craters that hit across the world in the past.

## Getting Started

[Live Demo](http://kenzomendoza.com/FCC-Map-Data/app/)

The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/map-data-across-the-globe).

It meets the following criteria:

>User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

>User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

>User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

This app was made possible by [FCC's API on Meteorites Strikes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json)
